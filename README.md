## Description

This is a site developed using react to showcase all I've learned so far from the coding bootcamp and present a professional portfolio to potential employers. I decided to familiarize myself with some additional npm dependencies during this project. MUI has some really useful and aesthetic component structures. I learned a good deal about manupulating elements and strive to keep imporving the overall aesthetic and user experience.
